# Blood Glucose Prediction 

This code uses data from the OHIO T1DM dataset as part of the 2020 BGLP challenge. It runs a variety of different algorithms to generate predictions for a half hour and hour prediction horizon of blood glucose levels for the different files in the dataset. The data requires a data use agreement. More information for this can be found at http://smarthealth.cs.ohio.edu/OhioT1DM-dataset.html. This code was strictly used for research purposes. Use of this code is permitted for comparison or reproduction of results, but the authors are not liable for any potential damages or problems that may occur.

This project uses some code from other sources. For convience links will be listed below followed by license files.
